# NLP-Transformers

This repository contains practical implementations of Transformer-based NLP models such as **BERT**, **GPT**, and other modern architectures.

> ⚠️ This is not a production project repository.
> It is a personal study reference that includes applied code based on the concepts I am learning.

## 📚 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

* Reinforce theoretical knowledge through hands-on coding
* Understand Transformer architecture in depth
* Practice tokenization and fine-tuning
* Experiment with different NLP tasks
* Keep organized notes for revision

This repository represents my practical learning journey in modern NLP.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

This repository focuses on understanding how models work internally — not just using high-level APIs.

The goal is to:

* Build intuition about Transformer mechanics
* Apply each studied concept directly in code
* Create a structured reference for future revision
